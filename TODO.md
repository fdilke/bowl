# To do

- port all the tests over from old GenericToposTest
- work out a simpler way to handle wrappings / fixtures, ideally without
    building the "test" fixtures into the "production" topos code. But maybe that would be easiest.
- port the algebraic structures code, less clunky this time but still with "auxiliary" types    
- do we still need the "arrow" types to be user-visible? Plan for this but to hardly use them.
